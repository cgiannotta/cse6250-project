# CSE6250: Big Data for Health Informatics Course Project

## Description

This repository holds code for the final course project for Georgia Techâ€™s CSE6250 course (Big Data for Health Informatics). The project is meant to replicate the analysis from the paper Comparing Deep Learning and Concept Extraction Based Methods for Patient Phenotyping from Clinical Narratives, by Gehrmann at al.

## How to install and run:
1. Download MIMIC-III data and join with annotations from authors. Alternatively, you can download their word2vec embeddings here.
2. Download our annotations.csv file (add link) and run python preprocess.py data/annotations.csv w2v.txt. This outputs two h5 files, one with data split into batches and one without batches. 
3. Run python basic_models.py --data data-nobatch.h5 --ngram 5 to get baseline performance. You can uncomment the classifier lines (74-76) in basic_models.py to specify which type of basic model (Logistic, Naive Bayes, or SVM) you wish to run.
4. Run cnn file (fix this reference).

## How to use

This methodology could be used to analyze a variety of text data, though the more similar it is to the MIMIC discharge summaries the more likely the model is to give similar output.
